            <h4>Brief Wrok Experience</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">I developed the detail design of the telephony system using Cisco CUCM with VMware hypervisor in Cisco UCS 220 bear metal server. There were one CUCM publisher server, two CUCM subscriber servers and Cisco unity CUC recording server and Cisco enterprise licensing manager. There servers were deployed as virtual machines running on hypervisor. The following virtual deployment was made in the system using Cisco Collaboration Virtual Machine Placement Tool.

            <p class="text-justify">LAN System was the one of my best focused system since my core skills were Cisco routing and switching technologies. LAN System was divided into two separate networks which were B-LAN (Business LAN) and S-LAN (Service LAN). Each system was deployed as campus collapsed Core network topology as facility was not so large. There were two layer such as Core/Distribution layer and access layer. Two Cisco Catalyst 6509-V-E were configured as VSS (virtual switching system) to acting as single logical core switch to provide interVLAN routing and WAN routing features.
